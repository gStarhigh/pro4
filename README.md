# Django project (Project Portfolio 4) for Code Institute.

## General information
Starh√∂gs Equestrian is a website where you can improve your dressage riding skills. The website provides you with the ability to create your own account and add in your personal details, should you wish. After a user has created their account they can now book riding lessons with an instructor. 

The website has full CRUD functionality, which means that a user can:
- Create a booking.
- Read/View their booking.
- Update their booking.
- Delete their booking.

The idea for this website was to create something that could help my wife with her real life dressage lesson business and make it easier for her to maintain and have control over her schedule. Although there is more that I want to add to the project, this will be future implementations, which you can read more about further down in this documentation.

## UX
The purpose of the site is to provide an easy understandable website with a simple and easy way for the user to create a booking. The site should be pleasing to the eye and to make a booking should be very simple.
No flashy colors were used, but the colors were calm and pleasing to interact with.
A favicon were used to make the website look better in the tab-bar.

### Colors and Fonts used:

#### Font
The Font I chose is from GoogleFonts and are free to use. I chose the font called "Roboto" with sans-serif as a fallback font. 
Roboto is clean and easy to read. 

#### Color
The main colors used on the site are:
- The text color for the site is: #3c153b.
- The background color for the site is: #88ab75.
- The navbar and the footer uses the color: #99c084. 



## Project Goals
The project goals was to create a website using the Django Framework in Python along with HTML CSS and Javascript. A user should be able to create a booking for their dressage lesson at available times and should be able to be up to 3 participants per lesson. 

A Database was set up to handle all data and to ensure correct booking and tracking was applied. 

A user should not be able to create or edit any booking without being authorized on the site. Contacting the admin does not require a login status.

## Testing

#### Lighthouse result
The test was conducted on the Home page.

A good result was presented on the desktop test.
    <details>
    <summary>Desktop</summary>
    <img src="documentation/lighthouse/desktop.PNG">
    </details>


On Mobile the result was not as good as on desktop. It seems that the boostrap cdn along with the emailjs cdn causes the page to render slower on mobile.

## Future improvements

1. Having 2 databases, one for local testing and one for the deployed version. This would not flood the deployed versions database with test data.

2. Make it possible for a user to send in a request for a place at the summer pasture by creating a booking system for it.

3. Make it possible for a user to send in a request for a place at the stable boxes by creating a booking system for it.

4. Email confirmation to the user when a dressage lessons status has changed from "Awaiting approval" to "Confirmed" - This would be possible right now, however emailJS only allows for 2 free templates and both are used in the project already for more important features. 

5. When making a booking, have the user see a form of calendar where all dates that were available for booking were presented. When the user chooses a date, all available times that date are then displayed for the user. After the user has chosen a time, the user is taking to the form to fill out the remaining required information.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Solution** |
|-------------|------------|
| If you book a lesson where the lesson is full, emailJS will still send out an email. | I believe an AJAX request to the server would solve this - Future implementation. | 
| Error in console: "Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'ch-ua-form-factor'." | What I've understood this has something to do with Google's end. It has no affect on my site and everything works as it should. If i delete my iframe, the error disappears. I have found no solution to this, and as it does not affect the functionality, the iframe is left in the project. | 
| To the right of "remember me" and to the left of the checkbox, there is a symbol which I cannot seem to remove.  | Unknown. I have tried all I could think of but could not get it to disappear. Perhaps usage of crispy forms would be an idea. |

## Deployment
#### Creating the Heroku app
Install Django and Gunicorn:
- Step 1: pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn

Install supporting libraries:
- Step 2: pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2

Install Cloudinary Libraries:
- Step 3: pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
- Step 4: pip3 install urllib3==1.26.15

Create the requirements.txt file:
- Step 5: pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

Create the project (Do NOT forget the dot at the end! Replace PROJ_NAME with your own projects name. ):
- Step 6: django-admin startproject PROJ_NAME .

Create the app (Replace APP_NAME with your own app name):
- Step 7: python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME

- Step 8: Add the installed app to installed apps in settings.py (In my example my project and app name are equestrian and bookings):
    <details>
    <summary>Installed apps example:</summary>
    <img src="documentation/deployment/installed_apps.PNG">
    </details>

Migrate the changes:
- Step 9: python3 manage.py migrate

Run the server to test that it all works.
- Step 10: python3 manage.py runserver

You will now see a yellow error screen when viewing the site:

- Step 11: Copy the link on the screen and add it to your "Allowed Host" in your settings.py file(Here I have both my Heroku link and the local link, you should add your Heroku link here aswell when the project is deployed).
    <details>
    <summary>Allowed hosts example</summary>
    <img src="documentation/deployment/allowed_hosts.PNG">
    </details>


 Create the Database using ElephantSQL
- Step 12: Log in, or create an account at [ElephantSQL](https://elephantsql.com/).
- Step 13: Click "Create new instance".
- Step 14: Choose a name for your project.
- Step 15: Choose your plan (Choose Tiny Turtle for the free option).
- Step 16: Tags are optional to fill out, then press "Select region".
- Step 17: Choose the region closest to you.
- Step 18: Return to the dashboard and choose your newly created project.
- Step 19: Under "Details", find the URL for your database and copy it. The link starts with "postgres://...." (We will use this soon)

Back to creating the Heroku APP.
- Step 20: Login to Heroku and click "New" -> "Create new app" to start a new project.
- Step 21: Choose an "app name" and "Region" - Then press "Create app".

Adding Config Vars

- Step 22: Click on Settings tab, and choose "Reveal Config Vars"
    <details>
    <summary>Heroku Navbar</summary>
    <img src="documentation/deployment/heroku_index.PNG">
    </details>
- Step 23: As key type: DATABASE_URL
- Step 24: As value: "The link you copied earlier from ElephantSQL".
    <details>
    <summary>Config Vars Example</summary>
    <img src="documentation/deployment/config_vars.PNG">
    </details>

Creating the env.py file to store all your sensitive information.
- Step 25: Create a file named "env.py" at the root of your directory.
- Step 26: At the top of the file type: import os

Adding the database URL:
- Step 27: os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "The link you copied earlier from ElephantSQL"

Adding the Secret Key (either make up your own or use the one in settings.py(Your project CANNOT have been pushed to github if you use the one in settings.py!)):
- Step 28: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = " Secret key goes here "

Add the Secret key to herokus config vars.
- Step 29: As Key: SECRET_KEY
- Step 30: As Value: "The secret key you have in env.py"

Settings.py:
- Step 31: At the top of the file add the following code:

import os

import dj_database_url

if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env

from pathlib import Path

Find the SECRET_KEY and replace the secret key code with:
- Step 32: SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
    <details>
    <summary>Secret Key Image</summary>
    <img src="documentation/deployment/secret_key_settings.PNG">
    </details>

- Step 33: Comment out, or delete the following Database code:

DATABASES = {

'default': {

'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',

'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',

}

}

Create the new Database link with the following code:
- Step 34: 

DATABASES = {

'default':

dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))

}

Now we can save all files and migrate all the changes. Make sure that your project has never been pushed or commited to github with the secret key you now have in your env.py file, if so, make up a new secret key.

- Step 35: In the terminal type: python3 manage.py migrate

- Step 36: Login or create an account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

- Step 37: Copy your CLOUDINARY_URL from the Dashboard.

Add the following code to your env.py file:
- Step 38: os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = ( The link goes here )
Make sure the link looks like this: ""cloudinary://************************"

In Herokus Config Vars, add the Cloudinary url:
- Step 39: As KEY: CLOUDINARY_URL
- Step 40: As Value: "The same link as in env.py"

- Step 41: As KEY: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
- Step 42: As Value: 1

- Step 43: As KEY: PORT
- Step 44: As Value: 8000

- Step 44.2: As KEY: DEBUG
- Step 44.3: As Value: FALSE

#### In Settings.py

Add Cloudinary Libraries to installed apps (The order is important!)

- Step 45: Add the following code:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [

    'cloudinary_storage', <- This is new

    'django.contrib.staticfiles', (This was here before...)

    'cloudinary', <- This is new

    ]

Telling Django to use Cloudinary for media and static files:

- Step 46: Add the following code:

    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = ('cloudinary_storage.storage.'
                        'StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage')
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'

    DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'

Link all templates files

- Step 47: Place the following code beneath BASE_DIR:

    TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')

Change template directory within the templates array:
- Step 48: Add the following code:

    'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],

- Step 49: Do step 11 again, only this time add the HEROKU link aswell.

Create 3 new folders at the root of the directory
- Step 50: media, static, templates

Creat the Procfile at the root of the directory (Note the capital P)
- Step 51: Create Procfile
- Step 52: Add the following code to the Procfile:

    web: gunicorn Your-project-name.wsgi

Now we are all set to deploy the project to Heroku.
- Step 53: Navigate to Settings and under buildpacks, add:"heroku/python"
- Step 54: Navigate to Heroku and choose Deploy.
- Step 55: Deployment method, Link your Github.
- Step 56: Connect your app to Github.
- Step 57: Choose Automatic, or Manual Deploy (I Recommend Automatic).

- Step 58: Choose Deploy Branch.

Your project will now build and be ready to use. Good luck!

## Github Pages
- This project was developed using Gitpod which I used to commit and push to GitHub using the terminal in GitPod.(Note that this project was deployed to Heroku and that those steps also must be followed.)
### Here are the steps to deploy a website to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository, locate the Settings button on the menu.
- Under Source, click the dropdown called None and select Main Branch.
- The page will refresh automatically and generate a link to your website.
### Forking the GitHub Repository
- By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
### Making a Local Clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
