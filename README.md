# Django project (Project Portfolio 4) for Code Institute.

## General information
Starh√∂gs Equestrian is a website where you can improve your dressage riding skills. The website provides you with the ability to create your own account and add in your personal details, should you wish. After a user has created their account they can now book riding lessons with an instructor. 

The website has full CRUD functionality, which means that a user can:
- Create a booking.
- Read/View their booking.
- Update their booking.
- Delete their booking.

The idea for this website was to create something that could help my wife with her real life dressage lesson business and make it easier for her to maintain and have control over her schedule. Although there is more that I want to add to the project, this will be future implementations, which you can read more about further down in this documentation.

## UX
The purpose of the site is to provide an easy understandable website with a simple and easy way for the user to create a booking. The site should be pleasing to the eye and to make a booking should be very simple.
No flashy colors were used, but the colors were calm and pleasing to interact with.
A favicon were used to make the website look better in the tab-bar.

## Project Goals
The project goals was to create a website using the Django Framework in Python along with HTML CSS and Javascript. A user should be able to create a booking for their dressage lesson at available times and should be able to be up to 3 participants per lesson. 

A Database was set up to handle all data and to ensure correct booking and tracking was applied. 

A user should not be able to create or edit any booking without being authorized on the site. Contacting the admin does not require a login status.

## Deployment
Creating the Heroku app


---
## Github Pages
- This project was developed using Gitpod which I used to commit and push to GitHub using the terminal in GitPod.(Note that this project was deployed to Heroku and that those steps also must be followed.)
### Here are the steps to deploy a website to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository, locate the Settings button on the menu.
- Under Source, click the dropdown called None and select Main Branch.
- The page will refresh automatically and generate a link to your website.
### Forking the GitHub Repository
- By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
### Making a Local Clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
