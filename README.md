# Django project (Project Portfolio 4) for Code Institute.

## General information
Starh√∂gs Equestrian is a website where you can improve your dressage riding skills. The website provides you with the ability to create your own account and add in your personal details, should you wish. After a user has created their account they can now book riding lessons with an instructor. 

The website has full CRUD functionality, which means that a user can:
- Create a booking.
- Read/View their booking.
- Update their booking.
- Delete their booking.

The idea for this website was to create something that could help my wife with her real life dressage lesson business and make it easier for her to maintain and have control over her schedule. Although there is more that I want to add to the project, this will be future implementations, which you can read more about further down in this documentation.

## UX
The purpose of the site is to provide an easy understandable website with a simple and easy way for the user to create a booking. The site should be pleasing to the eye and to make a booking should be very simple.
No flashy colors were used, but the colors were calm and pleasing to interact with.
A favicon were used to make the website look better in the tab-bar.

## Project Goals
The project goals was to create a website using the Django Framework in Python along with HTML CSS and Javascript. A user should be able to create a booking for their dressage lesson at available times and should be able to be up to 3 participants per lesson. 

A Database was set up to handle all data and to ensure correct booking and tracking was applied. 

A user should not be able to create or edit any booking without being authorized on the site. Contacting the admin does not require a login status.

## Flowchart

### Structure
The structure of the website is divided between authenticated user and not authenticated.
- Register page gives the user the possibility to create an account.
- Login page gives the user the possibility to login to an existing account.
- The Home page is visible for all users and displays images and information about the site.
- The Contact page is visibile for all users and displays a contact form. If the user is authenticated, the Username and Email will be pre-populated. If the user is NOT authenticated, the user will have to provide that information before submitting.
When the form is valid and sent, an email is sent to both the admin and the user.
- The About page displays images and information of the business. There is also an embedded video and an Google Maps API that displays the location.
- My Bookings page is only accessible if the user is logged in and displays all bookings made by the user. If there is no bookings made, an message will be displayed: "You have no bookings yet". The bookings are sorted by date. As a User you can filter your bookings by three variables: 
    
    All: Displays all bookings, regardless of date or status.

    Upcoming: Only displays "Approved" lessons that has not passed.

    Completed: Only displayes "Approved" lessons that has passed.
- The Book a lessons page is only accessible if the user is logged in. It displays the form neccessary to complete a booking. Here the user will be asked to enter the following information:
    
    Focus for the lesson
    
    Date: You are only able to book Monday to Friday.

    Time: You are only able to book the following times:
    18:00,19:00,20:00,21:00.

    Number of participants: Up to 3 people can share a lesson time.

    Level of the ekipage: Your level of dressage skills, chosen from a dropdown list.

    Terms of booking: A checkbox that must be checked. Terms can be read by pressing the link "Read terms here", that will open a modal.

## Deployment
Creating the Heroku app


---
## Github Pages
- This project was developed using Gitpod which I used to commit and push to GitHub using the terminal in GitPod.(Note that this project was deployed to Heroku and that those steps also must be followed.)
### Here are the steps to deploy a website to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository, locate the Settings button on the menu.
- Under Source, click the dropdown called None and select Main Branch.
- The page will refresh automatically and generate a link to your website.
### Forking the GitHub Repository
- By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
### Making a Local Clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
